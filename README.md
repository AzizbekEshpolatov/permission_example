# Permission Practice

## Project Purpose
This project is designed to practice requesting and managing permissions in a Flutter application using the `permission_handler` package. It covers handling permissions for storage, camera, location, and other system resources.

## Clone Repository
To get started, clone the repository:
```sh
 git clone <https://github.com/AzizbekEshpolatov/permission_example>
```

## Additional Information
- Ensure you have added the necessary permissions in the Android `AndroidManifest.xml` and iOS `Info.plist` files.
- Test on a real device as some permissions may not work properly on an emulator.
- Open `App Settings` if permission is permanently denied.
